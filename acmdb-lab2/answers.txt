Design Decisions
In the bufferpool£¬the evinction policy which I used is LRU. And for convenience, I used the LinkedHashMap to manage the pages, which taking place of the HashMap in lab1.And for the BTreeFile, I implemented it 
according to the documents.
 
 --------------

I have implemented all of the required parts, but I do not consider some codes that are not required in the lab1 | lab2.

--------------

I finished it in about 4-5days(including reading the textbooks and the documents). And I think for me, the most difficult parts in this lab is figuring out the details of the property of B+ Tree and 
getting familiar with the documents, as well as inserting and deleting tuples in the bufferpool(managing the dirty pages).
