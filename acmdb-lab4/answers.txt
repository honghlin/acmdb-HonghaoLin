Design Decisions

In the Tablestats, I scan the tuples twice and set two histogram arrays, Inthistograms and Stringhistograms, and use a boolean array isInt to manage them. For the other part of the project, I just follow the instructions. 

 --------------

I have implemented all of the required parts, but I do not consider some codes that are not required in the lab4.

I finished it in about 2-3 days(including reading the textbooks and the documents). And I think for me, the most difficult parts in this lab are the order of join and something I did not implement correctctly
 before(for example, the alias in the seqscan).
