Design Decisions

In the Aggregator, I have used several maps for convenience. 

 --------------

I have implemented all of the required parts, but I do not consider some codes that are not required in the lab3. For example, I think some codes in the Headpage like something about the dirty id 
may have some problems

--------------

I finished it in about 3-4days(including reading the textbooks and the documents). And I think for me, the most difficult parts in this lab is the some details about Aggregator and Section 2.3.And one 
confusing thing is that in the DeleteTuple() in the Headpage, if I delete the code "tuples[idx] = null;", I will be failed in the Delete Systemtests.But I think actually the more important thing is the Header, 
not it.
