Design Decisions

In this lab, I use the page granularity locks, and, in concrete, I have set 2 maps to record the locks in tid, pid and permission, not explicit implement shared and exclusive locks, but record the permissions of the lock and then use it to tell the kind of the lock. For the dead-locking detect policy, actually, I have implemented a dead-locking detect policy by detect cycle in the dependency graph, but unfortunately, there are stillsome bugs I can not solve. So finally, I used the time-out policy.

 --------------

I have implemented a LockManager to manage the locking. Every time when we need to get the page and commit the transaction, we should first use the methods in the LockManager.
